# Bash Guessing Game
_This script is an academic project for **Operating Systems** Course as an application on using Linux and writing bash scripts_

## Abstraction & Introduction
This project is a number guessing game designed in the way that the user thinks of any number between 1 and 1000, and the script will try to get the correct guess as fast as possible. The script is written in bash language. The mechanism of this game applies the concept of binary search, where we set a beginning point, an end point and compare the value in the middle, according to the result we adjust the beginning and end point to omit half of the interval. This process is continuous until we find the correct guess.

The script can run on Linux devices inside the terminal, and on windows devices through bash-like third-party applications as `Git Bash`, `Cmder`.

## Design
The script contains a main function called `play` which is responsible for executing the whole game. It sets the start point to 1 and the end point to 1000 to cover the whole interval, then it introduces the game to the user and gives them 10 seconds to think of a number. The program starts to guess using the midpoint of the start and end points. The guessing is continuous where each time the user is prompted to decide whether the guess is correct, higher or lower than the answer. The response of the user is handled in a case statement which modifies the start and the end according to the response. If the user enters an invalid input, they will be prompted to reenter a valid one.

When the program guesses the correct answer, it will ask the user if they would like to play again. This will recall the `play` method one more time repeating the whole logic.

## Implementation
1. Clone the repository into your local machine
2. Open the terminal and navigate to the repository directory
3. Run `bash script.sh`
